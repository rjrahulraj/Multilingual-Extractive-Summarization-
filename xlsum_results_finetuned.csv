A #MeToo moment for Democrats Analysis - Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York When asked what assurances Mr Cuomo could give that there weren't more women who would lodge complaints, he didn't really answer directly, instead repeating that he never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable. But that is a question probably weighing heavily on Democrats who, having taken a strict view of these kinds of allegations in the past, are now facing their own #metoo test in relation to one of the biggest stars in the party. Not only is he facing an investigation into sexual harassment claims by the NY Attorney General's office, but also a federal investigation into how he handled data on nursing home deaths, undercounting the true toll. And I think it should be encouraged in every way,"" Mr Cuomo continued. The mounting scrutiny on the governor follows Mr Cuomo's admission that he made a ""mistake"" in withholding data about Covid-19 nursing home deaths in the state.",0.0967741935483871,0.024390243902439022,0.056451612903225805,0.004895508954365221,0.17564625562765532,0.04027600213885307
