extractive,"Trump vows to end 'American carnage' Trump's angry call to arms Full text of Trump's inauguration speech It's unclear whether the president-elect actually wrote the speech himself, but the content was pure Trump: the same populist message that resonated throughout the primaries and the campaign. ""Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people,"" he said at the beginning of his remarks. Trump spoke of a country whose citizens had too long been ignored by the coastal elite: ""Their victories have not been your victories. Trump said the country was poised to ""free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow"", as well as ""eradicate from the face of the Earth"" radical Islamic terrorism. Writer Ben Shapiro expressed doubt about Trump's plans to both take power away from DC, and use his position as President to steer trade and create jobs. ""After three months in which Trump is president and it's still the same Washington, that speech is going to seem wildly imprudent,"" wrote Noah Rothman, assistant editor at Commentary Magazine.",0.09401709401709402,0.008620689655172415,0.05128205128205128,0.0028498724116873307,0.07444168734491316,0.024738289415836334

Questions raised by the sudden appearance of flowering plants are at the heart of Darwin's abominable mystery, he explains.

Darwin toyed with the idea that flowering plants might have evolved on an as yet undiscovered island or continent. In a lecture to the Geologists Association in the library of University College London, Carruthers highlighted the problems that Darwin had with the fossil record, focussing on the sudden appearance of flowering plants.

extractive,"""The typewriter is especially adapted to feminine fingers. The typical typist was a liberated woman. But her job was a boring one. Women were cheaper than men, and took over the jobs that were previously filled by young boys, who would have been supervised by an older man because it was so mind-bendingly boring. ""It was almost unbelievably soothing to sit in the quiet upper room with nothing to do but lay out banknotes in patterns like patience cards,"" she wrote. ""Learning all about the little marks on them, crossing them up in piles like card houses, sorting them in sixties and finally entering their numbers in beautiful ledgers made of the very best paper, as if intended to last out all ages."" In the late 19th Century it was inconceivable to have men working alongside typewriter girls, for fear of damage to their morals. An autobiography by a male employee at the Bank of England recalls how ridiculous it all was. A particularly patronising piece was published in the Liverpool Echo in 1911: ""These intrepid typewriter pounders, instead of being allowed to gloat over love novels or do fancy crocheting during the time they are not 'pounding', should fill in their spare time washing out the offices and dusting same, which you will no doubt agree is more suited to their sex and maybe would give them a little practice and insight into the work they will be called up to do should they so far demean themselves as to marry one of the poor male clerks whose living they are doing their utmost to take out of his hands at the present time."" But actually the arrival of women in the office wasn't altogether bad for men. If they had working daughters - as many did - their households were better off. And then, of course, the women were easy on the eye and possible candidates for future wives and mistresses. Thanks to the marriage bar (which, extraordinarily, stayed in place until the 1960s), the supply of women was constantly replenished - as they married and left, new girls took their place. It was their job to look after the younger typists. She wrote with some bitterness: ""The girls show a zeal and zest which no boy thinks of emulating. They have become mere machines.""
